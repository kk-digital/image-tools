    # - utility to output a .png, showing these "training patches" produced from a specific 
    #           image or directory of images (size n x m in tiles/patches specified) (Work on it)
    
    # - option to extract patches on grid (offset of 32x32 pixels) or randomly 
    #                         (When chosen to random what should be the number of patches?)
    
    # - option to specify "border" of N pixels, where patches will not be taken if they are within border region (What?!)
    # - ability to process N random files from input directory and produce N example images with square MxM grid of "random patches" of specified size.
    # - specifciation of output directory (Okay)
